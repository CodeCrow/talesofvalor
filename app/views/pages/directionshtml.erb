<h1>Directions to the Camp</h1>

<p>Your goal is to reach Camp Howe in Goshen, MA.  Unfortunately, directions directly to the Camp, as seen in Map 1, can be a little misleading.  Use Map 2 as a better reference and GPS marker if you are unfamiliar with the area and the camp.  The green arrow in Map 2 is the service road you will want to drive down.</p>
