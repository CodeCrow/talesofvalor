<h1>Veteran Player Introduction</h1>

<p>If you have LARPed before and are wondering what makes ToV different from other LARPs out there, here is a quick list of highlights.</p>
<p><strong>Theme and Feel: </strong>&nbsp;The theme of our game is heroic fantasy designed to spur character growth and development. The atmosphere is intended to be on the darker side with many opportunities for players to slide down the slippery slope of questionable behavior. Plots are geared to challenge the players mentally, emotionally, and physically and things are never as black and white as they may appear on the surface. </p>
<p><strong>Setting:</strong> The world of Jhoril and its various races, cultures, and features are a unique creation of our own design. Interwoven in its lore and information is a wealth of detail and work influenced by a variety of world mythology and ancient history including European, Celtic, Asian, and Roman. While you may find traces of familiar knowledge from each, we endeavor to highlight our own unique take on these elements. Continuity in our game world and the stories told is very important to us. </p>
<p><strong>Immersive RP Experience: </strong>This is our standard and expectation from everyone involved with our game from player to staff member. While you are playing in our game you are expected to remain in character 100% of the time, with the exception of obvious circumstances (emergencies, check in/out, sleep time, showers, etc...). Once you are signed into the event and walk onto the event site you remain in character from the game on mark until you leave or the game out mark is reached. This creates a rich game world with no distractions from game play. Everything that occurs within the playing area is considered to be in game at all times during game play. The only out of game buildings are the Logistics building, Staff sleeping areas, designated player sleeping arraignments, Restrooms, and emergency facilities. For more information on our games see the events section of this site. </p>
<p><strong>Hit Location Combat: </strong>We use a lightest touch hit location combat system. In order to strike someone with your weapon you actually need to safely swing the weapon and hit a specific location on your opponent. We have a rules section that details the regulations governing this type of combat and how to play out the effects (if you are hit). This does mean that there is a chance that you could be hit on the top of your head and your character knocked unconscious by a single shot if you are not careful. On the other hand it does mean that your character can not be knocked unconscious from being hit in the ankle. We feel our system is fair, in that you need some personal skill to be able to hit your opponent yet balanced through skills that allow you as a character to gain abilities that reflect the game system and the growth of a character in that system . We actively encourage our players and staff to strive towards greater physical skill in weapon usage because it creates a safer playing environment and a more enjoyable experience. </p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong>: Our staff has a vast number of years combined experience in various LARP systems to draw from in ensuring that the experience is an enjoyable one. We take great pride in providing a top notch LARP experience regardless of whether you are a new player or a grizzled veteran. We always strive to maintain a staff to player ratio that ensures there is something going on for everyone who wants to be involved. Your safety is our primary concern and we do everything we can to ensure that our game is safe and enjoyable to play while pushing the limits of creativity and inventing new and interesting ways to impress our players. </p>
<p><strong>Dedicated Site:</strong> We have a dedicated campsite with cabins, bathrooms, showers, usable structures and resources that we utilize in the playing of our game. This dedicated campsite allows us to better create your playing world and maintain cohesion between events. It also means a more relaxed camping atmosphere without fear of being washed away, having to use a composting outhouse or having somewhere dry and warm. We openly and actively encourage game participants to bring decoration materials with them to decorate their cabins and add that extra flair to the living spaces to make them feel more like building in our world and not just camp cabins in the woods. </p>
